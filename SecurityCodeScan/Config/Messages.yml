SCS0004:
  title: Certificate Validation has been disabled
  description: Certificate Validation has been disabled. The communication could be intercepted.

SCS0007:
  title: XML parsing vulnerable to XXE
  description: The XML parser is configured incorrectly. The operation could be vulnerable to XML eXternal Entity (XXE) processing.

# Crypto

SCS0005:
  title: Weak random generator
  description: The random numbers generated could be predicted.

SCS0006:
  title: Weak hashing function
  description: "{0} is no longer considered a strong hashing algorithm."
  title2: Possibly weak hashing function
  description_unknown: "Unable to determine hashing algorithm statically. Review if it is strong enough (SHA256 for example)."

SCS0010:
  title: Weak cipher algorithm
  description: "{0} is not considered a strong cipher for modern applications. Currently, NIST recommends the usage of AES block ciphers instead of {0}."

SCS0011:
  title: CBC mode is weak
  description: This specific mode of CBC with PKCS5Padding is susceptible to padding oracle attacks. An adversary could potentially decrypt the message if the system exposed the difference between plaintext with invalid padding or valid padding.

SCS0012:
  title: ECB mode is weak
  description: "ECB mode will produce the same result for identical blocks (i.e.: 16 bytes for AES). An attacker could be able to guess the encrypted message. The use of AES in CBC mode with a HMAC is recommended guaranteeing integrity and confidentiality."

SCS0013:
  title: Weak cipher mode
  description: The ciphertext produced is susceptible to alteration by an adversary. This mean that the cipher provides no way to detect that the data has been tampered with. If the ciphertext can be controlled by an attacker, it could be altered without detection. The use of AES in CBC mode with a HMAC is recommended guaranteeing integrity and confidentiality.

SCS0016:
  title: Controller method is vulnerable to CSRF
  description: The annotation [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] is missing. It can be ignored/suppressed if .NET Core AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken is set up globally.
  title_audit: CSRF token validation is explicitly disabled, review if the controller method is vulnerable to CSRF
  description_audit: The validation is explicitly disabled with [IgnoreAntiforgeryToken] directly or either in base class or method.
  title_frombody_audit: Review if the JSON endpoint doesn't accept text/plain
  description_frombody_audit: If there is code to accept text/plain the endpoint might be vulnerable to CSRF.

SCS0017:
  title: Request validation is disabled
  title_base: Request validation disabled in base class
  description: Request validation is disabled. Request validation allows the filtering of some XSS patterns submitted to the application.

SCS0018:
  title: "Path traversal: injection possible in {1} argument passed to '{0}'"
  description: The file path passed to this API is susceptible to Path traversal attacks. With a malicious relative path, an attacker could reach a secret file.

SCS0019:
  title: OutputCache annotation is disabling authorization checks
  description: Having the annotation [OutputCache] will disable the annotation [Authorize] for the requests following the first one.

# Configuration issues

SCS0021:
  title: "Request validation has been disabled in {0}({1}): {2}"
  description: Request validation, which provides additional protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), has been disabled.

SCS0030:
  title: "Request validation is enabled only for pages, not for all HTTP requests. {0}({1}): {2}"
  description: The RequestValidationMode property specifies which ASP.NET approach to validation will be used.

SCS0022:
  title: "Event validation is disabled in {0}({1}): {2}"
  description: Event validation is disabled. The integrity of client-side control will not be validated on postback.

SCS0023:
  title: "View state is not encrypted in {0}({1}): {2}"
  description: View state is not encrypted. Controls may leak sensitive data that could be read client-side.
  
SCS0024:
  title: "View state mac is disabled in {0}({1}): {2}"
  description: View state mac is disabled. The view state could be altered by an attacker. (This feature cannot be disabled in the recent version of ASP.net)

# XSS
SCS0029:
  title: Potential XSS vulnerability
  title_assignment: Potential XSS vulnerability
  description: The endpoint returns a variable from the client input that has not been encoded.

# Password Validator

SCS0015:
  title: "Hardcoded password in {1} argument passed to '{0}'"
  title_assignment: Hardcoded password
  description: The password configuration to this API appears to be hardcoded. It is suggest to externalized configuration such as password to avoid leakage of secret information.

SCS0032:
  title: "The RequiredLength property of PasswordValidator should be set to at least {0}"
  description: "The minimal length of a passwords is too short."

SCS0033:
  title: "Less than {0} properties set in PasswordValidator declaration"
  description: Password requirements are weak. PasswordValidator should have more properties set (RequiredLength, RequireDigit, RequireLowercase, RequireUppercase and/or RequireNonLetterOrDigit).

SCS0034:
  title: "The {0} property must be set"
  description: This property must be set to increase password requirements strength.
